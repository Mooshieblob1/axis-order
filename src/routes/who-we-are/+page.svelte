		Axis Order is a chaotic little experiment — part community, part fandom vortex, part art
		collective. We’re a group of weirdos making weird things, united by good taste, questionable
		jokes, and an appreciation for the bizarre corners of the internet.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-6 text-lg">
		Whether it's collaborative media projects, ranking anime girls, or simply hanging out in our
		cozy Discord pit, Axis Order is whatever we feel like making it. No rules, just vibes.
