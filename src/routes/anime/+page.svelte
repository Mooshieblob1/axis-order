	<p class="mb-6 text-lg">
		Anime is at the heart of Axis Order’s cultural chaos. Whether it’s making tier lists, planning
		watchalongs, or arguing about which waifu would actually stab you, we take anime seriously (but
		not too seriously).

	<p class="mb-6 text-lg">
		If you're the kind of person who has passionate opinions about obscure OVAs or just wants to
		vibe with others during a late-night stream, you'll fit right in.
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg">We even rank anime endings. Yes, it's that deep.</p>
